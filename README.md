Onion Architecture: (Yes/No)

Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?

Yes, I'm familiar with the Onion Architecture principle in software design. It is a software design pattern that separates core business logic from external parts like databases and user interfaces, promoting maintainability, testability, and flexibility by using layers and dependency inversion.

MVC Pattern: (Yes/No)

Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?


Yes, I'm familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern used for building web applications. It The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern separates a web application into three components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and updates the Model and View), promoting organized and maintainable code.


Web API: (Yes/No)

Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?

-No //

Application & Bottlenecks: Onion Architecture:

Benefits: (1-3 keywords)

Maintainability
Testability
Flexibility

Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

Separation of Concerns
Testability
Flexibility
Maintainability
Dependency Management


Dividing the functions through different layers allows the architecture to have a systematic and methodical approach to providing outputs.
Isolation of modules allows for a more comprehensive way of detecting issues and weaknesses within the infrastructure, by doing so you can isolate the problem without affecting the other layers' individual roles.
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)

Using Onion Architecture was tough because I didn't have all the info I needed. I had to use different tutorials for different parts, which made everything messy and confusing instead of organized."


MVC:
Components: (1-3 keywords each)

Model, View, Controller

Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.

Model: Manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
View: Handles the display and presentation of data to the user.
Controller: Manages user input, processes it, and updates the Model and View accordingly.

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)

Yes, I've had trouble with the tight connection between the Model and Controller in MVC projects. It's mainly because I didn't fully understand how to link them properly, which made separating their responsibilities tricky.

Web API:

Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.

I'm not entirely clear on the main difference because I don't fully grasp how traditional MVC apps work. But I do know that with Web APIs, it's like a black box: users ask for something, and the API gives them the data they requested.

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)

The biggest challenge I had with traditional MVC apps was setting up all the required parts. And with Web APIs, I struggled with dependencies and didn't know how to fix them when things went wrong. To make things work together, I tried using older versions of some dependencies to avoid compatibility issues.
